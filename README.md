# Program Design, Abstraction, and Problem Solving
Each directory contains a lab or project from my course.

There is also a testing and tutor project I was working on that contained all of the exercises where you can run each lab/project or enter a tutor mode to quiz yourself on concepts from the course. Originally that was this whole repo. but I recognized it was a bad/ineffecient way to show what I wanted to with this repo, which was showcase my experience with these concepts. I have let it here as I might still find a way to make it work, atleast the tutor mode.
